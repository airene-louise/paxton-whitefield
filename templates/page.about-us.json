As London became increasingly affluent Sam Cullum (Stephen's son) moved his cheese business closer to his wealthy customer base, near to Jermyn Street where there is still a shop today. He also took on two new partners - Harry Paxton and Charles Whitfield. Ironically it is their names, not his, which grace the shop fronts now. The Company's reputation grew steadily, culminating in 1850 with the honour of being appointed cheesemonger to HM Queen Victoria. It was the first of many Royal Warrants that the Company has held.<\/p>","use_collection_content":false,"background_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#000000","text_align":"left","margin":0,"padding":40,"full_width":false,"max_width":900,"spacing":10}},"images_three_dkWJwG":{"type":"images_three","blocks":{"image_8aFcQz":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Our_Heritage_Page_-_Jermyn_Street_Sign_3_-_600x700px.jpg"}},"image_PMtAeN":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Our_Heritage_Page_-_Jermyn_Street_Frontage_-_600x700px.jpg"}},"image_TNW79p":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/3b5edbe23f999e45fd02934e78df2367.png"}}},"block_order":["image_8aFcQz","image_PMtAeN","image_TNW79p"],"settings":{"margin_desktop":0,"margin_mobile":0,"padding_desktop":0,"padding_mobile":0,"background_color":"#ffffff"}},"content_richtext_7XKMTf":{"type":"content_richtext","settings":{"content":"<p>While the earlier years were good for Paxton & Whitfield, times were tougher from the 1860s. Smart society's appetite for traditional English farmhouse cheese was fading in favour of Continental cheese and, in England, factory style production was becoming the established practice. Many artisan cheeses totally disappeared as small farmers sent their milk to industrial creameries. This trend continued throughout the two World Wars and, in the 1940s, with eggs, butter and cheese in short supply 93 Jermyn Street became an ordinary grocery shop.<\/p><p>After World War II and a series of different owners, business improved as Paxtons rekindled their contacts with the traditional cheesemakers of rural Britain and started bringing in the best that Europe could offer. Two new Paxtons opened, in Stratford upon Avon and Bath not to mention their virtual shop on the web. Customers who value quality know they will always be able to find it at Paxtons. As Winston Churchill once observed \"a gentleman buys his cheese at Paxton & Whitfield\".
